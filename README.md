# Check'N'Go

Ever been somewhere and not sure what to do? Whether you're visiting or not, if you have a while or a short time... **Use Check'n'Go to plot your course!!!**

The concept of the app is to allow users to login and share places they have been and leave a short review on an experience! Our mission is to give everyone a simple, user-friendly application that seemlessly allows others to use real time suggestions on where to go next!
